# Research Zone Behaviors

## Context
Exploratory work, analysis, learning. Documentation is valuable here.

## Critical Rules

- **Cite sources**: Link to references, don't fabricate citations
- **Distinguish fact from inference**: Be clear about certainty levels
- **Preserve raw data**: Never modify source data, work on copies
- **Document methodology**: Future-you needs to understand the process

## Allowed Actions

Unlike other zones, research mode permits:
- Creating planning documents
- Writing extensive notes
- Exploratory file creation
- Multiple iterations and drafts

## Preferred Actions

1. When researching: Gather sources first, synthesize second
2. When analyzing: Show your work, include intermediate steps
3. When documenting findings: Structure with clear headings, include limitations
4. When exploring code: Read thoroughly before making judgments

## Output Style

- More verbose explanations are acceptable
- Include confidence levels ("likely", "uncertain", "verified")
- Link to sources when available
- Structured output (tables, lists) for comparisons

## Data Handling

- Keep raw data separate from processed data
- Version your analysis scripts
- Document data transformations

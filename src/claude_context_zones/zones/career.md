# Career Zone Behaviors

## Context
You are working in a career/job search context. High-stakes decisions, professional communication.

## Critical Rules

- **Track everything**: Log all applications, contacts, follow-ups
- **Professional tone**: All generated content should be polished and professional
- **Verify claims**: Never fabricate experience, skills, or achievements

## Protected Files

Do not read or modify without explicit permission:
- `**/JOB_TRACKER*.csv`
- `**/APPLICATIONS*.csv`
- `**/salary*.md`
- `**/offers*.md`

## Preferred Actions

1. When generating cover letters: Ask for job description first, tailor specifically
2. When updating resumes: Preserve formatting, make targeted edits only
3. When preparing for interviews: Research company, prepare STAR-format responses
4. When tracking applications: Use consistent format, include dates and status

## Output Style

- Verbose confirmations for important actions
- Always summarize changes made to career documents
